- [x] Move from ebiten to terminal rendering
- [x] Human key package
- [x] Basic editing features
  - [x] hjkl and arrow keys
  - [x] Mode switching
  - [x] insert mode
  - [ ] file writing / reading
- [ ] Windowing system
  - [x] Orchestrating
  - [ ] Rendering
    - [x] basic drawing
    - [ ] range based drawing (for when content goes out of rendering bounds)
    - [x] render cursor based on current window start
      - [x] What if the cursor is managed by the window that has focus? we can pass a isFocused parameter...
  - [x] Move to editor being a window too
    - [x] Center window
    - [x] The buffer is a tab local window
    - [x] Movement commands are easy: they should apply to ANY buffer, just make Buf() return the currently focused buffer
    - [x] Editing commands too should simply apply to the current buffer (just that the buffer can be written to)
    - [x] Where do we store filenames and other editor's tab's buffer specific data?
      - [x] Also easy, we move it from the Tab to the Window.
      - [x] UI buffers have no filename, which means they are "scratchpads"
      - [x] Mode, sequence and all that is saved in the Window of course.
      - [x] Tab becomes just a collection of tab local windows
  - [ ] Ability to get a window by id, both on editor and tab
        This is for plugins that need other windows data
- [x] Plugin "api"
  - [x] Base Plugin interface
  - [x] DumbPlugin implementation
  - [x] Access to editor stuff
- [ ] interactive windows
  - [ ] Interactive windows have a special type of buffer.
  - [ ] Some commands (eg Enter) are forwarded to the interactive window, which has it's own CommandMap and can manage and execute itself.
- [ ] Composite motions (eg c then iw, c then w, d then d)
  - [ ] Could have something where when c is pressed it starts catching events like the hidden "o" mode in vim, and when it's satisfied exceute command with motion and go back into normal mode 
  - [ ] Probably scope creep. Please just add a visual mode with operations and thats it
- [x] Color sections
- [x] Theming
- [ ] Command line

- [ ] add all the fun features
